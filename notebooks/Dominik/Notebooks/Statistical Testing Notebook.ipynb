It is not possible to directly prove or disprove an hypothesis using sample estimates alone, because these statistics will have inherent sample errors.\n","\n","So we need some technique or techniques to help us decide whether a sample parameter provides enough evidence to prove a hypothesis about the population parameter. These techniques are called statistical tests or hypothesis tests.\n","\n","These tests are designed to check if the sample results observed are statistically significant.  Put simply, in the example above we would like to know if the difference between males and females was due to random chance or due to a significant difference in expenditure between them.\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"JvXtdIiRdtoL"},"source":["# **2 Steps involved in a Statistical Test**\n","\n","**(i) State the Null and Alternative Hypotheses**\n","\n","The first step is to outline the objectives of the test. The Null and Alternative Hypothesis are opposing statements about the population parameter being tested. In general the researcher is trying to prove the Alternative Hypothesis by showing that the Null Hypothesis is false.\n","For instance, consider HR Research Ltd. who are examining pay rates in two different sectors, A and B, to test if there is a differences between them using a sample of employees from both sectors. In this case the Null Hypothesis would state that the Average Salaries in both sectors are equal, while the Alternative would state that the Average Salaries are not equal.\n","\n","Mathematically this can be written as\n","\n","Null\n"," \t$H_0$: $\\mu_{a} $  = $\\mu_{b} $  or  $\\mu_{a}-\\mu_{b} $ = 0 (Average Salary is equal in both sectors)\n","\n","Alternative\n","$H_1$: $\\mu_{a} <> \\mu_{b}$ or $\\mu_{a} - \\mu_{b} <> 0$ (Average Salary is not equal in both sectors)\n","\n","<br/>\n","\n","\n","**ii)\tSet the precision level**\n","\n","At the initial stage the researcher will also set the level of precision for the test. This is the level of confidence the researcher wishes to achieve before rejecting the null hypothesis.\n","The 95% confidence level is the accepted norm in Social Science and Business Research although occasionally some researchers will use other levels (99%, 90% etc.). Note we can never be 100% confident about a sample result.\n","\n","<br/>\n","\n","**(iii)\tGather sample data and calculate sample statistics**\n","\n","To test the hypothesis a sample of data is selected from the population and the relevant sample statistics (mean, standard deviation, proportion etc.) are calculated.\n","In the HR Research example, they would need to calculate the relevant descriptive statistics for the problem.

It is important to check these assumptions when using a test. Violations in assumptions can lead to incorrect conclusions being made, when interpreting the test results.\n","\n","**Parametric Tests (Normality assumption)**\n","\n","*The T-Tests and One-way Anova are from a family of tests called parametric tests, which are based on the assumption, that the test variable is Normally distributed.\n","This means that strictly speaking parametric tests can only be used for ratio/interval variables, that follow a Normal Distribution. This assumption is relaxed for sample statistics calculated from a large sample (n>50), but for smaller samples, the normality of the variable should be tested before using a parametric test.\n","If they are not Normal the non-parametric equivalent (Mann-Whitney U Test or Kruskal Wallis) should be used instead.\n","\n","\n","**Sample Size Requirements**\n","\n","Sample size is also an important factor. Clearly the bigger the sample size the more powerful the test and the more likely we are to identify statistically significant results. As well as looking at the overall sample size we need to look at the sample sizes in each group as well.\n","\n","- The strict minimum per group for a statistical test is 3, however the practical minimum will be higher for most tests.\n","- The minimum sample size per group recommended for the parametric tests is 10.\n","- There are similar requirements for non-parametric tests.\n","- The Chi-Square assumes an expected minimum sample size of 5 in each cell. If this assumption is violated it can affect the validity of the test. PASW/SPSS indicates how many cells violate this assumption.\n","\n","Sometimes it is necessary to collapse groups or remove a group from an analysis, if the small size within the group is too small.\n","Consider a class where there are 40 students; 15 from Ireland, 15 from the UK, 4 from Germany, 4 from France and 2 from Spain.\n","We cannot conduct a One Way ANOVA on the five groups due to small sample sizes. However we may decide to either just compare the Irish and UK students or combine the French, German and Spanish students into a third group.\n","\n","\n","**Independent Observations**\n","\n","The independence assumption is one of the most important and can have the most detrimental effects on the test results. All of the tests we examined here require independent measurements. In other words each data point must be independent of the others.\n","\n","For instance, if we have a set of monthly sales figures for a product, we cannot say that these are independent as clearly last month’s sales will have an impact on this month’s sales.\n","\n","This is only a sample of the issues involved in testing assumptions. It can be a complex issue as there will always be some violations of these assumptions, so we need to look at the size and nature of the violations.
