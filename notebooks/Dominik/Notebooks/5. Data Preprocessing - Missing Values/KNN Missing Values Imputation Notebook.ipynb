The KNN stands for K nearest neigthbors and the algorithm effectively finds the rows with non missing values that are closest to the row and the missing value. The values of the non missing neighbors are then used to create the estimate of the missing value. There are various approachs to this estimate and sjikit learn outlines it as follows:\n","\n","\"When the number of available neighbors is less than n_neighbors and there are no defined distances to the training set, the training set average for that feature is used during imputation. If there is at least one neighbor with a defined distance, the weighted or unweighted average of the remaining neighbors will be used during imputation. If a feature is always missing in training, it is removed during transform.
