What we mean by multivariate outlier detection is the use of more than one variable to identify an outlier. In univariate outlier detection we looked for individual outliers in a single variable. These univariate outliers may not show up if there are unusual combinations between 2 or more variables. This is where multivatriate outlier detiection comes in. The same principles as mentioned  in univariate outlier detection can be applied with multivariate outliers. In otherwords don't exclude particular rows of data unless you scientific evidence to support this.</br>\n","</br>\n","\n","\n","There are numerous approaches to multivariate outlier detection, some of which are outlined below:\n","\n","\n","*   Bivariate Charts\n","> * Based on bivariate Normal assumptions\n","*   Depth Based control charts (nonparameteric)\n","> * Map n-dimensional data to one dimension using for example Mahalanobis\n","> * Build Control Charts for depth\n","\n","* Mutiscale process control wavelets\n","> * Detects abnormalities at multiple scales as large wavelett coefficients\n","> * Useful for data with hetroscedasticity\n","> * Used in chemical process control\n","\n","In this section we will specifically focus on the depth based control charts as it is a reasonably reboust process and is quite quick to set-up.

This library calculates the Mahalanobis distance and then compares this to values for a hotellings t squared distribution to deterimine if they are outliers. Its like comparing a single univariate variable to a t-distribution. Have a look at this [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotelling%27s_T-squared_distribution) to understand this better.
