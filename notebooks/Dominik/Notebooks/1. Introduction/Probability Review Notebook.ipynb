To calculate the chance of an event happening, we also need to consider all the other events that can occur. The quintessential representation of probability is the humble coin toss. In a coin toss the only events that can happen are:\n","\n","* Flipping a heads\n","* Flipping a tails\n","\n","These two events form the sample space, the set of all possible events that can happen. To calculate the probability of an event occurring, we count how many times are event of interest can occur (say flipping heads) and dividing it by the sample space. Thus, probability will tell us that an ideal coin will have a 1-in-2 chance of being heads or tails. By looking at the events that can occur, probability gives us a framework for making predictions about how often events will happen. However, even though it seems obvious, if we actually try to toss some coins, we’re likely to get an abnormally high or low counts of heads every once in a while. If we don’t want to make the assumption that the coin is fair, what can we do? We can gather data! We can use statistics to calculate probabilities based on observations from the real world and check how it compares to the ideal.\n","\n","# 2 From statistics to probability\n","Our data will be generated by flipping a coin 10 times and counting how many times we get heads. We will call a set of 10 coin tosses a trial. Our data point will be the number of heads we observe. We may not get the “ideal” 5 heads, but we won’t worry too much since one trial is only one data point. If we perform many, many trials, we expect the average number of heads over all of our trials to approach the 50%. The code below simulates 10, 100, 1000, and 1000000 trials, and then calculates the average proportion of heads observed.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"1xgf1yyx3aco","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1705421704882,"user_tz":0,"elapsed":2953,"user":{"displayName":"Andrew Mccarren","userId":"16186536572019350587"}},"outputId":"ce15479b-020f-49b0-b6ec-cec5459b203b"},"source":["import random\n","no_tosses=10000\n","def coin_trial(no_tosses):\n","  heads = 0\n","  for i in range(no_tosses):\n","    if random.random() <= 0.5:\n","        heads +=1\n","  return heads\n","\n","def simulate(n):\n","    trials = []\n","    for i in range(n):\n","      trials.append(coin_trial(no_tosses))\n","    return(sum(trials)/n)\n","print('proportion of heads from ', no_tosses,' was ',simulate(1000)/no_tosses)\n","\n"],"execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["proportion of heads from  10000  was  0.4999599\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"KSqFe_XdMJtd"},"source":["*\tFrequently in business research the analyst is interested in the likelihood that a certain event will occur.\n","\t- what is the chance that sales revenue will be greater than €100,000 next month and\n","\t - how likely is it that an item produced by a machine will be defective? are examples of this.\n","\n","*\tThese questions can be answered, subjectively, based on a person's or group of people’s belief or objectively(mathematically) using Probability Theory\n","\n","<br/>\n","\n","An **event** is defined to be an outcome or a group of outcomes from a single random experiment or from several experiments."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"lw9_CgkCM6Mh"},"source":["*\tThe purpose of Probability Theory is to try to calculate the probability of a given event occurring.\n","\n","\tSuppose that an Event A can happen in k ways out of a possible n outcomes.
