In such a situation, what typically happens is that the hidden layer is learning an approximation of PCA (principal component analysis). But another way to constrain the representations to be compact is to add a sparsity contraint on the activity of the hidden representations, so fewer units would \"fire\" at a given time. In Keras, this can be done by adding an activity_regularizer to our Dense layer. The code below outlines how this works. In particular, look at the line in the code that specifies the regularization:\n","\n","> \"activity_regularizer=regularizers.l1(10e-5)\"\n","\n","Remember L1 regularization constraints the cost function with and absolute value of the magnitude of the weights\n","\n",">$\\lambda \\sum_{j=1}^p\\lvert \\beta_j \\rvert$ where $p$ is the number of weights\n","\n","L1 regularization shrinks the less important feature’s coefficient to zero thus, removing some feature altogether.\n","\n","In the following example we use the  [\"binary_crossentropy\"](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-binary-cross-entropy-log-loss-a-visual-explanation-a3ac6025181a) loss or cost function. This term effectively tries to maximise the Log-loss function and is very similar to the entropy calculations we did when attempting to discretize a continous variable. In this approach we are trying to match pixels rather than match the intensity of them which the \"mean_squared_error\" does.\n","\n","\n","Now when you print how out the hidden feature set you will notice that a number of them are zero. This means we have introduced sparsity into the autoencoder.\n","\n","Have a go at changing the loss function and changing the optimizers in the following code.
