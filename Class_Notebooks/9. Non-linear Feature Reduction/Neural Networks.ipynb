    "#**Neural Networks**\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the past number of steps you have learned how to use PCA, Lasso and Ridge regression to reduce the dimensionality of your datasets. One of the underlying assumptions with these methods is that the compression or dimesionality reduction is linear in nature.  PCA effectively creates new latent variables that are a new representations of the orginal data but of a significantly lower dimension. These techniques can be very useful when dealing with variables that are highly correlated or when you just want to simply reduce the volume of your input variables in order to improve the processing spead of your algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "So by now you may have come across the concept of Neural Networks. If you haven't then have a look at this [site](https://pathmind.com/wiki/neural-network#define). Neural Networks are algorithms that are loosely modeled on the human brain. The concept can be best described in Figure 1 below.\n",

    "Figure 1 (Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ ))\n",
    "\n",
    "You will definetly come across neural networks in other courses. They can can be used to build prediction models and as part of Autoencoders models which are used to reduce datasets and remove noise from our datasets.\n",
    "The principle behind them is that the input or our $X$ data is passed into the system through the input nodes. An input function is applied and this information is then transfered to the hiddend nodes, where an activation function transfers that information to the output function, Figure 2.\n",

    "\n",
    "[Figure 2](https://pathmind.com/wiki/neural-network#define)\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective is to minimize the difference between the outputs and the results of the activation function, by optimising the input and hidden node weights. Normally, optimization is done using algorithms such as [gradiant descent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent). Neural Networks will introduce a level of non-linearity and complexity into our data models, thus allowing for greater predictive power. The architecture of these systems can vary with the number of nodes in the hidden layer and the extension to deep learning architectures can be achieved through the addition of multiple hidden layers. In reality, this process will be equivalent to a linear regression model if we remove the hidden nodes and appply a linear activation function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we are going to implement a simple neural network regressor on the California housing dataset. It is important that you understand this simple example as you will need these learnings to build and Autoencoder which is the next step.\n"

They are effectively the block of data that we use to calculate the weights or the paramters. Normally, the training set is between 70 to 80\\% of the orignal dataset. The test set is a proportion of data that we keep back to test our algorithm. We should never use this data to calculate our weights and you should only use it once on any particular model that you develop."
