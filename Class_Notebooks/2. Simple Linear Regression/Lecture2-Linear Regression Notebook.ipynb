    "# **Linear Regression**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this class we will introduce the concept of regression models, with a particular focus on linear and logistic regression. This class is meant as a recap for those of you who may have struggled with it in previous modules or are new to the topic. We use a simple python examples to show how one would do basic regression analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will get into much more detail about these when we talk about Generalised linear models in MOOC 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is Linear Regression?**\n",
    "\n",
    "In many business research situations the path to decision making lies in understanding the relationship between two or more variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, can the price of airline stock be predicted using a variable like the cost of oil? or how strong a relationship is there between a company’s sales figures and their advertising budget?\n",
    "\n",
    "Regression Analysis is the process of constructing a mathematical model or function that can be used to predict one variable using another variable (simple linear regression) or variables (multiple linear regression). The basic idea is to create a line of best fit in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "By linear we are really saying we have a function such as:\n",
    "\n",
    ">$y_{i}=a+bx_{i} + e_{i}$ $ where $ $i=1 $ $to$  $n$\n",
    "\n",
    ">$y_{i}$ is known as the dependent variable and is generally the variable we are trying to predict and $i$ is the row number in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    ">$x_{i}$ is the independent variable and is the one we are using as a predictor variable.\n",
    "\n",
    ">$a$ is the intercept and is the expected mean when $x_{i}$ is zero.\n",
    ">$b$ is the slope or the rate of change in $y$ for a unit increase in $x$.\n",
    "\n",
    ">$e_{i}$ is **independently normally distributed with a mean of 0 and a constant variance**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear Regression can be considered has one of the most basic forms of machine learning or artifical intelligence. It uses a method called Min Squared Error to come up with the most appropriate values of $a$ and $b$. It does however assume that the error term is independently normaly distributed with a constant variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a data mining position we will use it in a number of ways and they are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Predict missing values\n",
    "*   Identify important features in a dataset\n",
    "*   Understand if there are hidden features\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The wonderful thing about linear regression is that we can easily understand the impact independent variables have on the outcome or dependent variable. The draw back is that things can go very wrong if we break the assumtpions such as the normality of the error or the consistency of the error variance. These are important issues and should not be overlooked.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also worth framing in your mind the idea of $y_{i}=a+bx_{i} + e_{i}$ as a basis for all prediction problems. I appreciate we cannot predict all variables with one input or independent variable or the assumption that the functinal structure is linear, but when we try to solve a problem it is always good to try and ask yourself what are the output/dependent and input/independent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "Fedbus have been using radio advertisements to advertise their weekend excursions for the past 8 months. The managing director has asked the sales team to assess the effect of these ads on the number of bookings.\n",
    "\n",
    "The example data for this example can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UVZozqcZdOX8vnM7t1DZurs2yJJpEcE4/view?usp=sharing)\n"

    "So in the code above we have completed a regression plot. You will see a shaded plot around the line. This corresponds to a 95% confidence interval for the regression. This will often be inside the actual points because we are predicting a confidence interval for the mean no of bookings for a particular no of adverts and not the overall no of bookings. This sounds strange but when we implement inferential statistics we always assume that the experiment can be repeated multiple times, and we measure the theoritcal range of the mean for these experiments. If you don't get this now don't worry, and for those who do, maybe you should read about the battle between frequentist and baysian statistics.

    "You will note that the $R^2$ is 0.75. This value will range between 0 and 1. Where 0 reperesents a complete lack of fit and 1 being a perfect fit. Remember, it is not the holy grail of modelling as in theory you will get a perfect fit if you have as many parameters as the number of data points.\n",

    "Generally, we do a few quick checks. The first is to examine the $P>|t| $ for each paremeter. The p value for the intercept ($a$) and slope ($b$) are given as 0.235 and 0.005 respectively. These results tell us that the intercept ($a$) is not significantly different from zero but there is strong evidence that independent $b$ variable is, as the p value < 0.05. This tells us that we could use a model with no intercept. But before we do this we should examine the AIC(55.20)(Akaike Information Criterion) and BIC(55.36)(Bayesian Information Criterion). Both of these terms are very useful as they will penalise large models relative to the information they are attempting to model. If you add more independent variables and the quality of the results does not improve then both measures will increase. So if we remove the intercept term we should derive new AIC and BIC statistics. The results are shown in the code below.\n",
