    "# **Logistic Regression**\n",
    "\n",
    "We have now recapped on inferential statistics, Analysis of Variance and Linear regression. But students always want to know how do I model categorical variables, or how do I classify a piece of data. Logistic regression is one of the simplest classifiers and we will give a quick introduction to it in this section. However, logistic regression comes from the Generalised Linear model family of models and we will examine it in much more detail in the later.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of Logistic Regression is to model binary outcomes. In linear regression we modelled continous outcomes such as sales or prices with independent variables. Logistic regression is used to model the probability of a categorical outcome/dependent variable. This variable will have 2 options which are either a 1 or a 0, and the logistic regression model will attempt to predict P(Y=1) as a function of X.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Logistic Regression Assumptions**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Binary logistic regression requires the dependent variable to be binary.\n",
    "\n",
    "* For a binary regression, the factor level 1 of the dependent variable should represent the desired outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Only the meaningful variables should be included.\n",
    "The independent variables should be independent of each other. That is, the model should have little or no multicollinearity. Multicollinearity occurs when a linear combination of one or more independent variables is collinear with another variable. This charactersitic has a habit of inflating the variance of the parameter estimate in question and can wrongly accept the null hypothesis that the variable is not significantly different from zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The independent variables are linearly related to the log odds.\n",
    "* Logistic regression requires quite large sample sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keeping the above assumptions in mind, let’s look at a dataset. The dataset is the success rate of people applying for a specific position. Each candidates Graduate Management Admission Test score, GPA score and work expreience were also recorded. The aim of this analyis is to determine which variables should be used when making a decision to accept or reject a candidate.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will read the data into a dataframe called candidates and this is outlined below:"

We will look at differing methods to standardise data in the next MOOC but **in the case of logistic or linear regression there is absolutely no need to standardise your independent variables**. In fact if you do this you will be actually reduce the volume of information from your model, thus reducing the models predictive power.\n",

When you center a variable the intercept becomes the mean of the Y variable at the value you centered on, but importantly the slopes/paremeter estimates will not change. But for this logistic model we will find that model will fail as well get \"perfect seperation\". This is usually caused by over specification of the model (To many variables). Try it out and see what happens. See if you can get results using 2 variables and no intercept. What do you notice about the p-values."

    "So we have only really shown how to run the logistic model, but we have not really examined the formula for it or the interpretation of the parameter estimates. We will address these issues in MOOC5 when we introduce the theory behind Generalised Linear Model.\n",

    "Finally, you will all want to try to predict class or continous variables. If you are doing this run the models on a \"training\" set. This is a subset of your data that your models will be trained on. The remaining part of the data will be treated as a test set. When your model is finalised on the training set you will then test it on your test set. There are a number of ways to select training and test sets and you always have to make sure they are properly balanced. You will learn a lot more about this in Machine Learning."
