    "# **Missing data Mechanism**s\n",
    "When we find missing data values in our data they are usually caused by 1 of 3 mechanisms outlined by Rubin (1976). It is very important that you understand them as they will have a major influence in how you treat your analysis. It will also determine if it is appropriate  to impute missing values. The following [link](https://stefvanbuuren.name/fimd/sec-MCAR.html) gives a nice explaination of the area. The 3 mechanisms are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "# **Missing Completely at Random (MCAR)**\n",
    "Missing Completely at Random is pretty straightforward.  What it means is what is says:  the propensity for a data point to be missing is completely random.\n",
    "\n",
    "There’s no relationship between whether a data point is missing and any values in the data set, missing or observed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The missing data are just a random subset of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "# **Missing at Random (MAR)**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where the unfortunate names come in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Missing at Random means  the propensity for a data point to be missing is not related to the missing data, but it is related to some of the observed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether or not someone answered #13 on your survey has nothing to do with the missing values, but it does have to do with the values of some other variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "A better name would actually be Missing Conditionally at Random, because the missingness is conditional on another variable.  But that’s not what Rubin originally picked, and it would really mess up the acronyms at this point.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is, if we can control for this conditional variable, we can get a random subset.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is another alternative to this case and exists where questions that have not been asked could determine if people answer the question in hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can imagine that good techniques for data that is missing at random need to incorporate variables that are related to the missingness.\n",
    "\n",
    "# **Missing Not at Random (MNAR)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Data are missing not at random (MNAR) when the missing values on a variable are related to the values of that variable itself, even after controlling for other variables. For example, when data are missing on IQ and only the people with low IQ values have missing observations for this variable. A problem with the MNAR mechanism is that it is impossible to verify that scores are MNAR without knowing the missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Can you think of examples of each mechanism?\n",
    "* If I have a variable that is not missing at random can I impute the the missing values?\n",
    "\n",
    "Now I would like you to download the data from this [link](https://openmv.net/info/class-grades). Now analyses the data and record which variables have missing values. The code below should get you going. Can you tell what type of missing process is occuring for the Final exam mark.\n",
