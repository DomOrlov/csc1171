    "# **Imputing Missing Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "As we have said previously many real world datasets have missing values. For many analysts the natural thing to do with these missing values is to use some imputation technique. The appropriateness of using imputation is dependent on the individual problem. Imputation techniques can be used to avoid losing important information that would be lost if one value was missing from a large row. This makes sense as datasets can be drastically reduced if every row with one missing value is removed from the analysis. Most statistical and machine learning packages will remove a row if one value is missing and generally you wont know. The problem with imputation is as follows:</br></br>\n",
    "\n",
    "* When do I use it?\n",
    "* What methods do I use?  </br></br>\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of packages such as Amelia in R, statsmodels.imputation.mice.MICEData or sklearn.impute in python that will complete the imputation for you. Also there is a substanial number of techniques ranging from replacing missing values with means of that variable to data simulators or propensity score modelling. The technique you use in your imputation is very much dependent on the cause of your missing values. My view is that **you should not impute**  in the following situations:</br></br>\n",
    "\n",
    "* When the variable in question is NMAR (unless you have evidence that this is a censored variable or you have apriori evidence on the distribution of variable in question).\n",
    "* When there are missing values in the outcome variable.</br></br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason for both these situations is that I generally follow the guiding principal that your imputation technique should not bias your results, I use missing value imputation as little as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will regularly start any analysis I do by modelling variables with missing values against a range of other variables in my dataset. So I code a new variable as Missing (Y/N) from the variable with a large number of missing values. I will then conduct a simple logistic regression on the remaining variables with the new Missing (Y/N)variable and examine if there are any relationships between Missing (Y/N) and the remaining variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets look at a simple example I have drafted below, where one variable has a number of missing values. We have 3 variables which are being proposed to predict \"happiness\". The first is a measure of Education attainment, second is work experience and the third is salary. Now if you follow my analysis below you will see there is a  strong relationship between the salary variable, educational attainment and work experience. In fact the correlation scrores are all around the 60% mark. Now we are faced with 2 problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Work experience is correlated with some of the other variables, so you could conclude that MAR is the most likely missing value mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "* or are the missing values missing due MCAR?\n",
    "\n",
    "* or is it due to NMAR?\n",
    "\n",
    "We cannot be sure here. However, I would initially conclude in this situation the problem is a MCAR or a MNAR, because when I do a logistic regression on the Missing Y/N that I created it is not significantly realted to either of the other 2 input variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now my choice here would be MCAR because there is no intuitive reason to tell you that people of one or other experience level would choice to leave it out.\n",
