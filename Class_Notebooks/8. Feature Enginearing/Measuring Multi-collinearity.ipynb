    "We then get the $R^2$ from each variables regression model and then calculate the VIF using the following equation:\n",

    "\n",
    "If your VIF factor is >10 then you really need to  drop variables from your model, but if it is between 5-10 then you need to consider it.\n",

    "\\[2\\] tells us that the inverted $X^tX$ matrix is close to non-invertible. This is telling us that there is possible multcollinearity in our data. The condition number is the ratio of the largest eigenvalue to the smallest eigenvalue in the $X^TX$(design matrix) matrix. Now this eigenvalue ratio may also be high becuase of scaling differences in our design matrix. So we will have to calculate the VIF's for each variable before we can decide what to do next."

Now if we remove these variable you will see the condition number is lower but still high, however the VIFs are all fine. This high condition number is purely a scaling issue as the Multicollinearity is now gone. The literature tells that a condition number above 20 is high. However, this can be caused by variables comming from differing scales as well as multicollinearity.\n",
