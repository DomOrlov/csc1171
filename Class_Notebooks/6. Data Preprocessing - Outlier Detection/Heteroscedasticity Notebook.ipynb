    "# **Heteroscedasticity and Linear Regression**\n",
    " \n",
    "In earlier topics we discussed the assumptions when building regression models.\n",
    "The simplest version of a linear regression model is $Y_i= a +b_1 +\\epsilon_i$.\n",
    "Where $\\epsilon_i$ is randomly and independently normally distributed around 0 with a constand variance. Heteroscedasticity occures when the variation in the error terms varies is not constant. It can be caused by the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* when there is a large range between the largest and smallest observed values (outliers).\n",
    "* When the model is not correctly specified \n",
    "* If observations are from mixed scales (farenheit to celcius) \n",
    "* Skewness  in the distribution of the regressor variable(dependent).\n",
    "\n",
    "From the above list we can see that we are assuming a linear model, but by using a linear model and examining the errors we can expose potential outliers in our data. I am not saying we have to stick with this model but using it initially can help you identify outlying observations. This [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/heteroscedasticity-in-regression-analysis/) will help you understand what hetroscedasticity is and how to calculate it. Have a look and use the code I gave you in MOOC1 1 topic 3.9 to help you examine the boston housing data for outliers.\n",
