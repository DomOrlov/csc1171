    "**Multivariate Outlier Detection**\n",
    "\n",
    "We are now going to look at multivariate outlier detection. What we mean by multivariate outlier detection is the use of more than one variable to identify an outlier. In univariate outlier detection we looked for individual outliers in a single variable. These univariate outliers may not show up if there are unusual combinations between 2 or more variables. This is where multivatriate outlier detiection comes in. The same principles as mentioned  in univariate outlier detection can be applied with multivariate outliers. In otherwords don't exclude particular rows of data unless you scientific evidence to support this.</br>\n",
    "</br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are numerous approaches to multivariate outlier detection, some of which are outlined below:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Bivariate Charts\n",
    "> * Based on bivariate Normal assumptions\n",
    "*   Depth Based control charts (nonparameteric)\n",
    "> * Map n-dimensional data to one dimension using for example Mahalanobis\n",
    "> * Build Control Charts for depth\n",
    "\n",
    "* Mutiscale process control wavelets\n",
    "> * Detects abnormalities at multiple scales as large wavelett coefficients\n",
    "> * Useful for data with hetroscedasticity\n",
    "> * Used in chemical process control\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we will specifically focus on the depth based control charts as it is a reasonably reboust process and is quite quick to set-up. The Multiscale process are beyond this material at this stage.\n",

This is where were the library [*scipy.spatial*](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.spatial.distance.mahalanobis.html)  comes in. This library calculates the Mahalanobis distance and then compares this to values for a hotellings t squared distribution to deterimine if they are outliers. Its like comparing a single univariate variable to a t-distribution. Have a look at this [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotelling%27s_T-squared_distribution) to understand this better. The code below is an example for the housing dataset of how to calculate the critical Hotellings T Squared value for the dataset. So any values whoes distance is greater than our critical value will be considered outliers.\n"

We then calcualte the Mahalanobis distance for each row from the overall multivariate mean $\\bar{X}$ (xbar). Use this distance with the covariance matrix to calculate individual Hotelling T Squared statistics and  then compare each one to the critical Hotellings T Squared values. You will notice that we have used the covariance matrix to helps us standarised the data using *pandas.cov*. There will be small differences between the chart above and the one below as we do not have the exact calculations from *pyspc* but by using the code below we can identify the outlier points."
