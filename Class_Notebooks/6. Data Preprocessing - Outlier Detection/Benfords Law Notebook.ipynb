    "# **The discovery of Benford’s law**\n",
    "Have you ever noticed what chance has a given number to start with the digit 1?Does the digit 1 has the same propability to be a leading digit as 9? To let you know that the leading numbers of a number represents its non zero left most digits. For example 29 and 0.037 are 2 and 3.Well the unswer in the previous question is no. According to Benford’s law, a.k.a. the first digit law, the frequency of occurrence of the leading digits in naturally occurring numerical distributions is predictable and nonuniform but more close to a power law distribution. In fact, a given number is six times more likely to start with a 1 than a 9! This is very illogical, as most people would expect a uniform distribution U(1,9) where all the digits have the same likelihood to show up in first slot so they expext a probability of 1/9 percent ~ 11,1%.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1881 Newcomb noticed that the pages in the front, used for numbers beginning with the lowest digits, were more worn than those in the back’s and that’s why the leading digits were much more likely to be small than large. Then, in 1938, physicist Frank Benford rediscovered the theorem of Newcomb by collecting over 20,000 samples of realworld numbers, using data sources as distinc as the measurements of rivers, street addresses, numbers contained in Reader’s Digest magazine, molecular weights, baseball statistics, death rates, and more. And because that he popularized this scientific discovery, he got all the credit.\n",

    "Benford's Law is an observation about the distribution of the frequencies of the first digits of the numbers in many different data sets. It is frequently found that the first digits are not uniformly distributed, but follow the logarithmic distribution:\n",
